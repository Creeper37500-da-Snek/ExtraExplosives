[c/FF4500:EXTRA EXPLOSIVES]
We have decided that terraria doesnâ€™t have enough fun explosives, so we came up with a solution! We introduce to you Extra Explosives! Extra Explosives takes old boring bombs and makes them useful again(Even in late game). You can even us the new combine feature (WIP) to make entirely new bombs from other materials and ammo. There is also a new way to reforge, we use bombs to reforge 3 items at one time! More info on the wiki. We are continuously updating and working on this mod, more explosives to come with some unique properties and explosions. Check us out on discord to voice your opinion and thoughts on bugs, balancing, and what other explosives you might like to see.
