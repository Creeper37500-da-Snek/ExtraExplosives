[c/FF4500:EXTRA EXPLOSIVES]
[c/00FF00:The Overhaul and Content Update! 3.0]
Over that past few months, we totally redesigned the old and boring explosives that remained in the game. We decided to give a little love to bombs and explosion, with this new update you can now manage how some bombs work! We incorporated a class within the mod that takes explosions to a whole new level. Check it out!
